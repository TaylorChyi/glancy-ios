# Repository Guidelines

This file defines global instructions for contributors. Nested `AGENTS.md` files provide additional rules for their directories.

## General
- Run `swift test` before committing. Include the output in the PR description.
- Use four spaces for indentation in Swift code.
- Keep code comments and commit messages in English.
- Commit messages should follow `type: summary` (e.g. `feat: add login flow`).
- Document significant changes in `README.md`.
