# Unit Test Guidelines

Rules in this file apply to the `GlancyTests` directory.

- Write tests using the Swift `Testing` framework.
- Keep each test fast and independent.
- Indent with four spaces, matching the main project style.
- Run `swift test` after modifying tests and include the output in your PR.
