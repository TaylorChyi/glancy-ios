# Glancy

Glancy is a premium multilingual dictionary app designed to provide users with quick and accurate translations and usage examples. With its intuitive interface and advanced language processing, Glancy helps language learners, professionals, and everyday users to explore words and phrases seamlessly across multiple languages.

## Overview

Glancy offers:
- **Multilingual Translations:** Get accurate translations and usage examples in up to three selected languages.
- **Advanced Search:** Use the bottom search bar with an integrated send button for quick word lookups.
- **Personalized Language Settings:** Choose your preferred languages from a curated list. These selections control which language buttons appear on the main screen and determine the translations displayed.
- **Cloud-Powered Experience:** Sync your search history, favorites, and settings securely across devices.
- **User Management:** Enjoy seamless sign-up, login, and profile management with options for both anonymous and full account usage.

## How It Works

1. **Smart Query:**
   When you search for a word, Glancy first checks its cloud database for a cached definition. If found, the result is displayed instantly; otherwise, our advanced language engine is used to fetch the translation and usage examples.
2. **Intuitive Interface:**
   The main screen features toggleable language buttons, a clear results area, and a bottom-aligned search bar with an embedded send button.
3. **Personalized Experience:**
   Customize your language preferences in the settings page. Your selected languages appear on the main screen and directly affect the translations retrieved.
