# Documentation Guidelines

These rules apply to all files in the `Docs` directory.

- Write documentation in Markdown.
- Keep line length under 100 characters.
- When adding images, use relative links and include descriptive alt text.
- Provide translations in English and Chinese when possible.
- Update links if files are moved.
