# Project Code Guidelines

The instructions in this file apply to all source files in the `Glancy` directory.

- Indent Swift code using four spaces.
- Name types and methods in English using UpperCamelCase for types and lowerCamelCase for methods.
- Document public functions with Swift style comments starting with `///`.
- Keep functions under 80 lines when possible.
- Run `swiftformat` if available; otherwise format manually before committing.
